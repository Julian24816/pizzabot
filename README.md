organize the shared pizza order of your party

## first POC:

- [ ] allow users to order their preferred number of normalized pizza slizes of 3 types: 
  - anything, 
  - without dead animals, 
  - without animal products
- [ ] calculate the ideal pizza order (can be dumb)
- [ ] host on my webserver pizza.julianm.dev

## lots of ideas for later:

- edit order with optional password
- admin page
  - start a new event, clear answers
  - edit available pizza types, sizes, and prices
  - choose constraint solver
- fancy constraint solving, e.g. with more pizza types, subtypes, wishes, priorities, ...
